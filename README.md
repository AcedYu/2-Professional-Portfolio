# 2-Professional-Portfolio
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is assignment 2 for the program. In this assignment I created a mock portfolio page for myself to showcase the work I have not done yet.

I implement programming concepts such as:
- flexbox
- media queries
- CSS variables
